# Queue checker
If you are a Russian in emigration, you probably face problems getting consular services: too long queues and the need to check your turn daily.
Remembering and storing codes/ids, becomes a real headache, especially if you are standing in multiple queues. I hate it, so let's automatise it.

## How to use it?
1. Add links to checking page to the orders.txt
2. Install the only dependency - Selenium and install Chrome browser, if you don't have it
3. Run main.py and fill in the captcha in console for every link you've added
4. Cross your fingers and see result
